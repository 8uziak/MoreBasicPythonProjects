### Description

The depository is a collection of projects that appealed to me at a given time. They are a collection of short but interesting projects. My favorite is a project called [Prime Factorization](https://github.com/8uziak/MoreBasicPythonProjects/blob/main/Prime%20Factorization%20.ipynb). A proper explanation of what this functionality does can be found here [link](https://www.cuemath.com/numbers/prime-factorization/).
